# Randocktail

This basic webapplication is created for proving my skills of `Node.js` , `Express.js` and `EJS` technologies.

## Overview

By every refresh, a random cocktail appears on the main page with its details, recepie and instructions.

### Public API

My local server is connected to a puplic API, which can be found here: [link](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).

## How to start the server

Make sure to install the node modules by typing `npm i` in your console.

Then you should be able to start the server with `nodemon index.js`.
